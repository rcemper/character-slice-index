### Prerequisites    
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.

### Installation  
Clone/git pull the repo into any local directory  

````
git clone https://github.com/rcemper/character-slice-index.git
````

Run the IRIS container with your project:   

```
docker-compose up -d --build   
```   
## How to Test it
```
docker-compose exec iris iris session iris  
```

There is a populate procedure that you can run from SQL Shell   
The reply is the last ID generated    
The default line size is 37 char.   
You can change it by passing some different size  

-  USER>do $system.SQL.Shell()   
-  [SQL]USER>>select rcc_slice.pop()     
   38  
-  [SQL]USER>>select rcc_slice.pop(15)     
   130  
-  [SQL]USER>>select rcc_slice.pop(50)    
   158  
-  [SQL]USER>>select documentid,count(*) lines from rcc_slice.data group by documentid      
   documentid      lines  
   28      28  
   43      92   
   62      38

Next we look for lines containing **ol**  
Classic approach:    

- [SQL]USER>>     
  SELECT ID, documentid, line, length(line), lineid    
  FROM rcc_slice.data WHERE line [ 'ol'  
- 27 Rows(s) Affected    
   statement prepare time(s)/globals/cmds/disk: 0.0841s/42,502/225,481/0ms  
   execute time(s)/globals/cmds/disk: 0.0010s/ 159 /4,444/0ms   
   cached query class: %sqlcq.USER.cls   

Character Slice approach:   

- [SQL]USER>>    
  SELECT ID, documentid, line, length(line), lineid   
  FROM rcc_slice.data WHERE line %CONTAINSTERM ('ol')   
- 27 Rows(s) Affected   
  statement prepare time(s)/globals/cmds/disk: 0.0847s/42,849/238,674/0ms   
  execute time(s)/globals/cmds/disk: 0.0011s/ 34 /3,900/0ms     
  cached query class: %sqlcq.USER.cls8   
 
Even with this small data sample we see only **34** Global Access instead of **159**   

Now let's look for 2 independent values **ol** and **w**    
Classic approach:

- [SQL]USER>>   
  SELECT ID, documentid, line, length(line), lineid   
  FROM rcc_slice.data WHERE line [ 'ol' and line [ 'w'  
- 4 Rows(s) Affected   
  statement prepare time(s)/globals/cmds/disk: 0.0805s/42,670/233,791/0ms  
  execute time(s)/globals/cmds/disk: 0.0004s/ 159 /2,340/0ms    
  cached query class: %sqlcq.USER.cls9

Character Slice approach:    

- [SQL]USER>>   
  SELECT ID, documentid, line, length(line), lineid   
  FROM rcc_slice.data WHERE line %CONTAINSTERM ('ol','w')     
- 4 Rows(s) Affected   
  statement prepare time(s)/globals/cmds/disk: 0.0901s/43,417/265,856/0ms
  execute time(s)/globals/cmds/disk: 0.0005s/ 15 / 1,632/0ms  
  cached query class: %sqlcq.USER.cls11

It's getting dramatic: less than 10% !    
Only **15** instead of **159** Global Access    
You are invited to extrapolation of these results
